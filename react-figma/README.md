Frontend Project Development
Use React to build only the home page of the the figma link attached below (from nav to footer).  
It should be responsive even if the responsive design was not provided. Just use your own idea
Make sure your work is optimised by: uploading large images to cloudinary, the icons should be downloaded as svg, React.memo,  lazy loading images (use the url of your cloudinary images. This means you' ll use react-lazy-load-image-component instead of cloudinary-react. Cloudinary-react might load all the images on your page thereby reducing your page load speed while react-lazy-load-image-component will only load the images when the user scrolls to it thereby increasing your page load speed) and code splitting your routes (involves: using lazy and suspense)
